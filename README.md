# AI-Checkers-Project
This project was first forked [techwithtim's](https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Checkers-AI) repo. His project only implemented a minimax algorithm to a game of checkers. Our project further develops on his to refine the minimax algorithm and include a Random AI agent that plays checkers with the goal of just acquiring a peice whenever possible.
