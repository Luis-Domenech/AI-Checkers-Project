# AI-Checkers-Project
This project was first forked from [techwithtim's](https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Checkers-AI) repo. His project only implemented a minimax algorithm to a game of checkers. Our project further develops on his to refine the minimax algorithm and include a Random AI agent. Additionally, our project also include modification to the original repo's Checkers simulation code in order to pit two AI models against each other.
